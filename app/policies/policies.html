    <div class="col-sm-6">
      <ul>
        <li class="policyCard">Each garment requires a minimum of two fittings.  Taking measurements does not count as a fitting.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">You must wear the underwear/foundation garments that will be worn with garment to all fittings and when getting measurements taken.  If you do not, it will result in a fee of 2% of agreed upon cost being added to the price to cover the extra work that will be required to alter the garment.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">Excessive weight gain or weight loss will result in a fee of 2% of agreed upon price being added to the cost to cover the extra work required to alter the garment.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">You will be required to put 50% down at the signing of the client agreement before work begins on garment.  This deposit is non- refundable.  25% percent is due at first fitting.  The remainder is due on completion of the garment(s) before they will be handed over.</br>EX: I charge you $200 dollars for a dress.  When you sign your client agreement you pay me $100.  I take measurements. We make a shopping appointment.  We make an appointment for your first fitting. After you purchase your fabric and notions (usually after the shopping appointment) I begin work on your dress.  When you come for that first fitting you pay me $50.  We make an appointment for your final fitting.  I finish your dress.  You try it on.  If you are satisfied we agree on a pick up or drop off.  I will launder and press your garment and sew in a small tag with my logo.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">At this time I do not take appointments in my home.  I will come to you.  I know that you will be excited or anxious (or both) about your garment.  I am too! Itâ€™s important to both of us that it be done well and in a timely manner.   But please respect and abide by my hours of operation when making calls or sending texts and please never show up at home unexpectedly.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">You will be required to pay for your fabric and any accompanying notions.  You are required to buy and bring your own pattern unless we agree upon something different beforehand.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">You are entitled to one shopping appointment with me.  You will receive 1 hour of my time where we will look at and talk about fabrics and other requirements of your pattern so you can make educated purchases.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">Extra shopping appointments are $40/hr.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">Please be on time for all appointments. This applies, to our first meeting, fittings, shopping appointments and pick up/drop offs or any other appointment not specified here.   If you are more than 10 minutes late I will leave.  If you are late and call before that 10 minutes expires it is a charge of $5 for every 15 minute I wait.  If you know you will be late and you call 15 minutes or more BEFORE the scheduled appointment we will discuss either rescheduling or I will wait up to 30 minutes past scheduled appointment before I start charging as long as I have no other appointments scheduled.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">If a finished garment is not picked up or received at the appointed time.  I will wait 60 days.  The garment(s) then become the property of Steamy Seamstress and may be disposed of how I see fit.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">If you cannot pay for your finished garment at the agreed upon time it becomes the property of Steamy Seamstress and may be disposed of how I see fit.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">No personal checks.  I only take cash or card.</li>
        <li class="policyCard">All clients are required to sign a client agreement that acknowledges and agrees to all policies and procedures.  You must divulge your full name, phone number and home address.  Steamy Seamstress agrees to never sell, share, or use any of these information for any other purpose other than to contact the client in relation to the work that I am doing for them.  Or in the highly unlikely case that a client defaults on their agreement and they need to be contacted for legal reasons.</li>
